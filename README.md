This C code is a simple program to swap the values of two variables `x` and `y` using a temporary variable `temp`. 

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
1. It prompts the user to enter the values of `x` and `y`.
2. It reads the values entered by the user using `scanf`.
3. It swaps the values of `x` and `y` using a temporary variable.
4. It prints the swapped values of `x` and `y` using `printf`.

This code demonstrates a common algorithm for swapping variables in programming. It's a fundamental concept in computer science and is often used in various applications and algorithms. 

This description provides a brief overview of the code's functionality and purpose, which can be useful for readers who come across the code in the GitHub repository's README section.
